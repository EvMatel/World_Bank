This class interfaces with the World Bank API and local CSV files to fetch, filter, and process
economic and development indicators for one or more countries. It allows users to explore and select relevant indicators, 
check data availability by country, and retrieve cleaned time series datasets. Built-in fuzzy matching improves user input flexibility 
when specifying country names. The class supports additional functionality like 
completeness filtering, interpolation of sparse data, and importing entire datasets for exploratory analysis.

I am actively working on this and planning on developing new features and upgrading existing ones as I learn more.
